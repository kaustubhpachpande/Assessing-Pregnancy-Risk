# Assessing-Pregnancy-Risk:ML-Modeling-and-Evaluation
- This project aimed to develop a machine learning model for risk stratification in maternal health, enabling early detection of high-risk pregnancies and aiding healthcare professionals in decision-making.
- I Utilized k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), logistic regression, and decision trees for risk stratification based on physiological health indicators.
- I further enhanced model performance using ensemble learning techniques such as boosting and bagging, achieving 83% accuracy.
- Implemented and executed the project in RStudio.
